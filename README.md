### Overview of Project:
  The purpose of this analysis was to measure the performance of our code after refactoring by looping through our data and gathering the run time. 
  This tests our efficiency in running our code.
  
### Results:
  Execution times of the refactored script compared to our original script were much faster by about a factor of 5 for both 2017 and 2018.

### Summary
Some advantages to refactoring code are to make code simpler and more efficient. This could be something as small as removing redundant lines of code and condensing into a smaller yet equally efficient code, or something larger, such as generating for loops that loop through your code with specific instructions and conditions.
Disadvantages to refactoring seem, to me, to be associated with time mainly. Personally, I believe that refactoring is a great way to clean up code and create more clear and concise programs, however sometimes the lack of time to meet deadlines, or time to study different techniques and test their efficiency, could be the main reason for not creating the best code.
